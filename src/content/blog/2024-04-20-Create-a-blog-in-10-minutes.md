**Easily** create your own free blog in less than 10 mins!

The blog will be hosted on [Github](https://github.com) and will use the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/) theme.

# Why Github and Jekyll?

* Github is the largest git source repository in the world and used by millions of people and organisations.
* Github makes it simple and easy to host Jekyll websites for FREE.
* Jekyll uses markdown text files for writing blog posts using a text editor. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) text editor recommended!
* No pesky databases or complex coding bits to worry about!

# Create your blog

1. Signup to [Github](https://github.com)
2. Click [Minimal Mistakes remote theme starter](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter/generate) link.
3. Enter a `Repository Name` and click `Create Repository`

# 2 options for updating your blog

## Option 1: Edit from Github (easiest)

1. On Github go to the repository created above.
2. Under code look at the list of files and find the `_posts` folder
3. You will find some sample posts which you can edit or create a new post.
4. Note you should name new posts with a date format eg yyyy-MM-dd-your-new-blog-post. Also use the `-` to seperate words.

## Option 1: Edit from your local pc (recommended)

1. Download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. Download and install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. Set your [git name and email](#set-git-name-and-email-address) instructions below
3. Clone the repository you created in Github.
4. You can now edit posts locally

### Set git name and email address

To push changes you must set your git name and email address. For your email I would recommend using your github private email address so that you don't get spammed.

### Find private Github email address

1. In Github click your profile icon on the top right
2. Go to Settings / Emails
3. Here you will find your private email eg `12345+yourname@users.noreply.github.com`

### Update your git config

In vscode type ctrl + ` to open a terminal

```bash
git config user.email "your email"
git config user.name "your name"
```

# Adding a custom domain name!

Having your own personalised domain name means you can protect and manage your own branding.

Github allows you host your blog with its own custom domain name eg dvkwong.com and there are
 many companies that sell domain names for a nominal fee as low as $10 US to $30 US per year.

I have used [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) (easier) in the past, however
I am switching to [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) (advanced) as it is even cheaper due to no markups!
